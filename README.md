# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker

[Check out the project here!!]()

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I used the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, I used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

The webapp is built using React JS and uses Bootstrap library for styling. I used the React version of the LeafletJS called [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/).
